<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are multiple definitions of "digital preservation," but among the more useful starting point definitions are the
   [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-definitions-of-digital-preservation">definitions-of-digital-preservation</a></cite>]
   posted several years ago by the American Library Association's Association for Library Collections and Technical
   Services. These include: "Digital preservation combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure access to reformatted and 
   born digital content regardless of the challenges of media failure and technological change. The goal of digital preservation 
   is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time." Various workflows and approaches (i.e., use cases) have
   been developed over time to create services that strive to meet this definition of digital preservation.</p>
<p>Captured here are some of these use cases and parts of use cases that provide context and articulate the requirements and expectations
   typical of archival services that are likely to archive PWPs. To add a use case, please copy and populate the template
   and insert as next new section below. The use cases are for now unordered. The template provided is adapted from the IG's Use Case Template.

    <h2> Preservation by caching, format migration on access -- a use case based on LOCKSS </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>Digital preservation is challenging because digital content must be rendered by software
            agents that evolve and change over time. In the case of the Open Web platform, Web
            browsers, HTML standards, CSS specs and rendering agents evolve. Accordingly document formats 
            evolve as well to ensure that the presentation of content is as intended. For this reason 
            content that has been captured in the past needs to be reformatted, i.e. have its formatting
            refreshed to continue to be viable in new Web browsers. This process is called format
            migration. LOCKSS uses a caching approach to update files preserved and 
            postpones archive-based format migration until a user actually requests the preserved content.
            LOCKSS crawls publisher Websites to retrieve the content it preserves and then disseminates
            this content by acting as a proxy cache for subsequent requests from Web Browsers, updating cached files
            as necessary for as long as a publisher copy remains available.  
            LOCKSS recognizes the need for format migration based on mismatches between the Accept: header
            provided by a Web Browser when requesting content and the MIME type of the preserved content. 
            A digitized registry of converters is then used to find and invoke an appropriate converter. 
            If no converter is found a 406 (Not Acceptable) response is generated. </dd>
